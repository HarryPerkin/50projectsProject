# Chat Log
## Escaping Tutorial Hell with Question Driven Development.

### A command-line OpenAI interface that prints and saves the responses.

The user inputs a text prompt. The console will print the response from the AI. The program will write a log of datetime, prompt, and response to *responses.txt* in the same directory.

### How to use:
Run the program with ```py chatLog.py``` or equivalent. The program will generate the *.txt file automatically.

### TODO:
1. Add the configuration to the log output.
